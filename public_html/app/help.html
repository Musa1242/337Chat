                <p>Welcome to 337Chat!</p>
                <p>By now, you have figured out how to create an account and login. Let us go over other features.</p>
                <p>On the home page, you can view your logo, information about your profile 
                    (click update profile to update details)
                     and browse your posts and your friendsâ€™ posts.
                     You may comment on posts at the bottom of each post section.</p>
                <p>
                    A nav-bar is featured at the bottom of each page to navigate to different pages.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Navigating to update profile allows you to change details about your profile. 
                    You can change your gender and change your profile picture. 
                    There are two options for profile pictures. 
                    You can either chose a file and press submit, and navigate to home to view 
                    your change, or, you can create a custom avatar by selecting an avatar variant, 
                    and avatar colors, and selecting Create Custom Avatar, then Submit, then navigate
                     to home to see your changes. You can also remove your current avatar on this page.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Navigating to search, you can substring search for either users or posts.
                     Searching for users pops up all users with that substring in their username. 
                     You can request to follow a user, and it will go through as a friend request for that user. 
                     Searching for posts, you can search by substring into the caption or username of who posted. 
                     Similarly to home, you can comment on users posts here. You will not see your own posts pop up here.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Navigating to friends, you can view your friends list, as well as a list of friend requests for you, 
                    of which you can chose to accept and that user will become your friend.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Direct messages allows you to chat with friends. You must pick one of your friends 
                    (must have friends to use) from the dropdown, and begin chatting with them with the text console below.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, you may press logout to logout of your account.
                </p>
                <p>
